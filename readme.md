##  Overview

Accurate prediction of crop prices is crucial for supporting farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions and minimizing economic uncertainties. This project focuses on building a robust crop price prediction framework by leveraging **ensemble** and **hybrid deep learning models**, incorporating both **historical market data** and **region-specific weather parameters**.

The research is centered on agricultural markets across **Tamil Nadu**, a state with diverse agro-climatic zones and a wide range of crop varieties.

##  Models Explored

The following hybrid and ensemble models were implemented and evaluated:

- **LSTM-GRU hybrids**
- **CNN-LSTM architectures**
- **Ensemble averaging techniques**  
- Traditional baselines for performance comparison

##  Data Sources

-  Historical crop price data from Tamil Nadu agricultural market boards  
-  Weather data (rainfall, temperature, humidity) from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) or equivalent APIs

##  Key Features

- Deep learning models trained on time-series market and weather data  
- Captures long-term and short-term dependencies affecting price trends  
- Outperforms traditional statistical methods in terms of accuracy  
- Designed to assist **farmers**, **supply chain planners**, and **policymakers** in making early decisions
